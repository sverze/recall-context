2026-01-11 14:00 - Weekly Sync - John Doe and Jane Smith

John: Hi Jane, thanks for meeting today. I wanted to discuss the progress on the API integration project.

Jane: Of course! We've made good progress this week. The authentication layer is now complete, and we're working on the data sync functionality.

John: That's great news. How's the team feeling about the timeline?

Jane: Pretty good, but we're having some issues with the rate limiting on the external API. It's slower than we expected, which might impact our delivery date.

John: Okay, that's important to know. Can you reach out to their support team by Wednesday to get clarification on their rate limits and see if there are any optimizations we can make?

Jane: Absolutely, I'll handle that this week.

John: Perfect. Also, we need to decide on the caching strategy for this integration. I've been thinking Redis would be a good fit given our latency requirements.

Jane: I agree completely. Redis makes sense here. We're already using it for other services, so it'll integrate well with our existing infrastructure.

John: Excellent. I'll document that architectural decision and share it with the broader team in our next architecture review meeting.

Jane: Sounds good. One more thing - we found a potential security issue with how we're handling API tokens. Nothing critical, but we should address it before going to production.

John: Definitely. Can you create a ticket for that and prioritize it for next sprint?

Jane: Will do. I'll get that in the backlog today.

John: Great. I think that covers everything. Is there anything else you need from me?

Jane: No, I think we're good. This was really helpful.

John: Perfect. Same time next week?

Jane: Yep, works for me. Thanks John!

John: Thanks Jane, have a great week!
